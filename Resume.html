        <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">I’m currently working on Adversarial Attacks on DNNs (FGSM), </span>
        
        investigated on adversarial perturbation attacks on Deep Neural Networks using the MNIST digits dataset as a benchmark. 
        and then evaluated adversarial retraining as a defense against adversarial perturbations. 
        The outcome of the evaluation is Retraining actually worked.. accuracy increased from 85% to 92% with e=0.196

        I’ve worked on a project to develop an interactive database management
        system (website) for an Insurance Company (WeDoSecure) using Relational database(MySQL). In
        which I’ve used Django REST Framework, as I first designed database using SQL, I
        converted them into models using Django feature(inspectdb).

        I've done regression anlysis on Oil Wells (Regression Analysis ) under Peter
        Kowalchuk. My motive is to find best possible features that contribute to SW (water
        saturation) in oil wells.

        In Cloud Computing course I have good knowledge in Open-flow protocols, worked on SDN
        controller "RYU" to establish a network.

        <P>
        <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">RESEARCH GROUP, KLU — MAY 2019 TO NOV 2019</span> 
        <br>I worked as a research assistant tin VLSI MEMS field, where I worked on reducing actuation
        voltages of RF MEMS switches by altering the structure of the switches. By altering beam
        designs and fabrication techniques we can arrive at voltages as low as 4.0.

        <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" >SYSTEMS JR. DEVELOPER, DUE TECHNOLOGIES — 2018 JULY- 2019
        JAN</span><br>
        After mastering python in my 4th year, I applied for embedded system developer in which
        I built seven projects. I was involved in both hardware and software.
        The projects are mainly for industrial purposes. One of them is temperature regulator for a
        fruit storage building.
        Piezo electric umbrella is developed for a student, Image recognition using Open CV
        
        library to identify human emotions are the other exciting projects I have worked on.

        <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> SOUTH CENTRAL RAILWAYS — 2016 SUMMER</span>
        <br>When I’m in my under graduation 2nd year, I secured an internship in South Central
        Railways. My job here is to monitor the communications between the Locomotive pilot and
        station master.
        In this 3 month internship I learned a lot about satellite communications and cell tower
        placement.</P></div>
