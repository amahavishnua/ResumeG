        I’m working on Adversarial Attacks on DNNs (FGSM), 
        investigated on adversarial perturbation attacks on Deep Neural Networks using the MNIST digits dataset as a benchmark. 
        and then evaluated adversarial retraining as a defense against adversarial perturbations. 
        The outcome of the evaluation is Retraining actually worked.. accuracy increased from 85% to 92% with e=0.196

        I’m worked on a project to develop an interactive database management
        system (website) for an Insurance Company (WeDoSecure) using Relational database(MySQL). In
        which I’m used Django REST Framework, as I first designed database using SQL, I
        converted them into models using Django feature(inspectdb).

        I've done regression anlysis on Oil Wells (Regression Analysis ) under Peter
        Kowalchuk. My motive is to find best possible features that contribute to SW (water
        saturation) in oil wells.
